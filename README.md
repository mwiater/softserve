## softserve

**NOTE:** Flipping this repo public as I've been using it a lot and a coworker asked me for the code. **It's still at the beginning stages**, but it's in a working state. Use wisely and at your own discretion! It's part of my current no-code instrumentation/tool kick.

## Features

| Feature             | Description                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Static file serving | Serve an entire directory of HTML, JS, CSS, and assets  |
| Live reload         | Auto-refresh browser on file changes (injected JS)      |
| API mocking         | YAML-based mock API routes mapped to methods and paths  |
| SSL support         | Built-in HTTPS support with self-signed cert generation |
| Single binary       | No Node, no runtime ‚Äî just `go run` or build a binary   |
| Graceful shutdown   | Ctrl+C cleanup built-in                                 |

## Notes

Mostely tested and used in Linux, but also should work in Windows.

### Frontend Works Out of the Box

Your frontend doesn‚Äôt need any special headers, credentials, or port remapping. It simply generates mock responses for api calls ‚Äî just as if the backend were alive.

This means:

* You can test **error cases** by returning status codes like 401, 403, or 500.
* You can **simulate latency** by adding it later as an advanced feature.
* You can **fully prototype** frontends without scaffolding a backend.

#### No-Touch = No Code

You do **not** need to:

* Add any custom routes in Go
* Define new handlers or switch statements
* Recompile the server

Everything is driven entirely by the contents of `api.yaml`.

## Installation

Clone and build:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mwiater/softserve.git
cd softserve
go mod tidy
```

`go run cmd/main.go serve --help`

```
Softserve is a lightweight local static file server tailored for frontend development.
It supports automatic browser reloads on file changes, static API mocking, and optional HTTPS serving.

Usage:
  softserve [command]

Available Commands:
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  help        Help about any command
  list        Group commands for listing resources
  serve       serve

Flags:
      --api                 enable API mocking
      --api-prefix string   API prefix (default "/api/")
  -h, --help                help for softserve
      --http-port int       HTTP port (default 8080)
      --https-port int      HTTPS port (default 8443)
      --log-level string    log level (default "info")
      --ssl                 enable HTTPS
      --web-root string     directory to serve (default "examples/basic")

Use "softserve [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## Configuration

Use command line flags to configure the server. Example (showing defaults):

```bash
go run cmd/main.go serve \
  --web-root examples/basic \
  --ssl=false \
  --http-port 8080 \
  --https-port 8443 \
  --log-level info \
  --api=true \
  --api-prefix /api/
```

## Serving Files (Repository Examples)

#### Basic Example

From the root of this repository, simply run with defaults:

```bash
go run cmd/main.go serve
```

```bash
üìÇ Web root: examples/basic
üåê Serving HTTP on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

Then visit: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

#### API Mock Example (with in-memory SSL):

From the root of this repository, simply run with these flags:

```bash
go run cmd/main.go serve --ssl --api --web-root=examples/api01
```

```bash
üìÇ Web root: examples/api01
üåê Serving HTTP on http://0.0.0.0:8443
```

Then visit: [https://localhost:8443](https://localhost:8443)

### Building and Releasing with Goreleaser

While the examples in this repository use the format `go run cmd/main.go ...`, in the real world you'll build, install and sun it with the `softserve` command.

A minimal `.goreleaser.yaml` is included for building cross platform binaries.
To create local snapshot artifacts without publishing run:

```bash
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean --skip archive
```

Then run:

`./dist/softserve_linux_amd64_v1/softserve`

Global install docs coming soon...

## Live Reload

* Automatically injected into `.html` files
* Watches all files recursively in the web root
* WebSocket client reconnects and triggers `location.reload()` on change

---

## Mock API System: How It Works (No-Touch Design)

The **Mock API** feature in *softserve* is a completely *no-touch* system ‚Äî it does **not** require you to modify or write any Go code to serve dynamic API responses. All responses are defined declaratively in a single `api.yaml` file.

### Goals:

* Serve fake API responses *without running a backend*
* Require **zero changes** to your frontend or backend source code
* Match only on **HTTP method** + **request path**
* Keep things deterministic and inspectable

---

## Development Notes

* All `.html` responses get live-reload JS injected (non-destructively)
* If `index.html` not found, returns 404 (no fallback routing)
* Ignores symlinks for safety
* Logs file changes and server events
